                 u"crater that are superposed on and thus younger than the ripples. These fresh craters have small dark "
                 u"pebbles scattered across their surfaces, which are most likely fragments of the impactor, suggesting "
                 u"that the dark pebbles and cobbles observed by Opportunity at Meridiani Planum are a lag of impactor- "
                 u"derived material (either meteoritic or secondary impactors from elsewhere on Mars). Two larger, fresh- "
                 u"rayed craters in Meridiani Planum bracket ripple migration; secondaries from Ada crater are clearly "
                 u"superposed on and secondaries from an unnamed 0.84 km diameter crater have been modified and "
                 u"overprinted by the ripples. Three methods were used to estimate the age of these craters and thus when "
                 u"the latest phase of ripple migration occurred. The inactivity of the ripples over the past ∼50 ka at "
                 u"Meridiani is also consistent with other evidence for the stability of the ripples, the lack of "
                 u"observed eolian bed forms in craters that formed in the past 20 years, and little evidence for much "
                 u"dune motion in the past 30 yr on Mars. Observations of crater morphology and their interaction with "
                 u"the ripples allow the development of a general time scale for craters in Meridiani Planum over the "
                 u"past million years.",

            u"the background. Rayleigh crater exposes a cross section of the ripple to the south, showing that the "
            u"banding on the east face of the ripple is made of layers that dip to the west. Steeper slopes suggest "
            u"a stronger, cemented near-surface layer also exposed in trenches. Rayleigh crater is 2 m in diameter "
            u"and 0.2 m deep. Note secondary ripples on the crater rim and ordinary ripples in the bottom of the "

            u"[11] On sol 1852–1853, Opportunity stopped amidst the highest concentration of small craters within "
            u"the cluster and imaged Rockingham, Rayleigh, Drake and Diligence craters from distances of less than "
            u"10 m with Navcam (and some targeted Pancam images). Rockingham, Rayleigh, and Drake craters are "
            u"entirely in sand and are shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7). These three craters are about 2 m in diameter,  "
            u"clearly truncate and are superposed on the ripples and their crests, indicating they are all younger. "
            u"Slightly steeper upper walls in Rockingham, lenticular layers exposed on the north wall of Rayleigh, "
            u"and a pear shaped interior depression in Drake all suggest interior layering and/or different "
            u"mechanical properties with depth. The layering exposed in Rayleigh (Figure 6) appears continuous with "
            u"banding commonly exposed on the east side of the north trending ripple, suggesting that this banding "
            u"is the surface expression of layers of material deposited during different phases of ripple growth. "
            u"Craters too small to detect in HiRISE images (a few tens of centimeters or smaller) are also found "
            u"nearby Rayleigh. Like the larger craters, eolian modification of these craters is minimal and limited "
            u"to small, centimeter size secondary bed forms that are perpendicular to and superposed on the larger "
            u"and older north trending granule ripples (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Diligence crater (1 m diameter) has a "
            u"sandy interior depression, but appears to have also sampled bedrock with blocks of ejecta that are "
            u"preferentially found to the north (Figure 8). Color Pancam images reveal dark centimeter size pebbles "
            u"sitting on top of the northern rim, and adjacent sandy and bedrock surfaces (Figure 9), which are "
            u"likely impactor fragments.",

             u"When the first frost crystals are forming on the sample, blue light is Rayleigh scattered more efficiently, "
             u"which increases the coherent backscattering opposition effect (CBOE). The CBOE is responsible for the surge "
             u"of reflected negative polarization at small phase angles from regolith surfaces containing particles smaller "
             u"than the observed wavelength (see Dlugach and Mishchenko (2013) and references therein). When small ice "
             u"particles are introduced onto the regolith, the second order scattering between ice and regolith dust "
             u"increases, thus increasing the probability of CBOE. The CBOE is more effective for second order scattering "
             u"than higher order scattering, and there is a point when the surface is covered by sufficient ice particles "
             u"to produce higher order multiple scattering across the surface, scrambling the linear polarization and "
             u"decreasing its overall averaged signal. This is the reason why, when the frost becomes thick enough and "
             u"it hides the regolith beneath, the linear polarization decreases to zero without any wavelength dependence. "
             u"Note that the minimum of is reached when the frost is tens of microns thick. This means that such a "
             u"thickness of small crystals is still allowing an efficient second order scattering between ice and dust grains.",
